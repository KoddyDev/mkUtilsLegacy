# mkUtilsLegacy
An utils plugin/lib for Minecraft Kotlin developers. (For legacy Minecraft versions - Paper 1.8.8-R0.1)

To use it to develop, you should download *mkUtilsLegacy-v.jar* and *EduardAPI-1.0-all.jar* and use them as depends in your project.
This is not only a lib, so you'll need to run the plugin shadow jar (mkUtilsLegacy-v-all.jar) in your server with the others plugins with depends from it.

This plugin/lib is developed by Mikael (MikaelMaster, TheSrMK, SrMK) and Vin√≠cius (Koddy, KoddyDev). This project uses EduardAPI's (https://github.com/EduardMaster/EduardAPI) some code parts (credits to Eduard (EduardMaster).
